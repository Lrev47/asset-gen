1. Executive Summary

  MediaForge is a comprehensive media creation and management platform that
  leverages AI to generate, analyze, and organize various media types (images,
  videos, audio, documents) across multiple projects. The platform provides a
  centralized hub for managing AI models (both API-based and local), creating
  structured prompts through JSON, and organizing media assets by project-specific
  fields.

  Key Differentiators

  - Multi-modal media generation (image, video, audio, document)
  - Hybrid model execution (API + local models)
  - JSON-based prompt engineering with image-to-prompt conversion
  - Project-based organization with customizable fields
  - No modals - full page navigation for better UX

  2. Product Objectives

  Primary Goals

  1. Unified Media Management - Single platform for all AI-generated media assets
  2. Flexible Project Structure - Adaptable to various project types (websites,
  marketing campaigns, portfolios)
  3. Model Agnostic - Support for multiple AI providers and local models
  4. Structured Prompt Engineering - JSON-based prompts for consistency and
  reusability
  5. Visual Intelligence - Image analysis and prompt extraction capabilities

  Success Metrics

  - Time to generate first media asset < 2 minutes
  - Support for 10+ different AI models
  - 90% prompt reusability across similar projects
  - Zero modal interactions (100% page-based navigation)
